Evaluating Genetic-Based Disease Prediction Approaches Through Simulation

This is a project which compares the effectiveness of various machine learning approaches on determening whether a genome has some feature such as leading to a disease. It generates random genomes with different frequencies of disease vs control genes. This looks at how different machine learning approaches work as the frequency of disease causing locations increases, for various methods of inheritance.

This runs in the Wolfram Language / Mathematica.
